# Data Analytics - Visualizing Data with Matplotlib

## INTRODUCTION

You have been contracted by a team of top-secret government officials, the Boys in Grey, to assist in their search for extraterrestrial life forms.  They have been carefully collecting information on UFO sightings for the past several decades, but don't know how to make sense of their data on their own.  Your task will be to take their UFO sightings data and use what you know about Pandas and Matplotlib to clean and visualize their data in a meaningful way.  Your conclusions and analysis will assist the Boys in Grey in their hunt for life beyond the stars.

Good luck!

## INSTRUCTIONS FOR SETUP

1. Create a GitHub repository for this project.  Remember to use a Python .gitignore and add a README file!
2. Clone your repository down onto your computer
3. Download the `.zip` file from this **GitHub** repository
4. Unzip on your computer, and move the files `Pandas_Matplotlib_User_Stories.ipynb` and `ufo_sightings.csv` into your own project folder
5. Open your project folder in Visual Studio Code
6. Select the file `Pandas_Matplotlib_User_Stories.ipynb`
7. Starting from the top of the page, begin working through each of the user stories using the corresponding code block
8. **Be sure to thoroughly test each code block before continuing to the next user story!**
9. Include your completed `.ipynb` file within your repository for submission!
